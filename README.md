ðŸŒ¾ Agriculture Dashboard using Tableau

This project presents a comprehensive Agriculture Dashboard built using Tableau to visualize key metrics related to crop production, profit, revenue methods, and regional yield data. It is designed to help stakeholders in the agriculture sector make data-driven decisions based on visual insights.




ðŸ“Š Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is divided into four major visual sections:


1. Yield Ton By Crop/Season
Purpose: Showcases the crop yield (in tons) for each crop across the three main agricultural seasons: Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid.

Insight: Helps in identifying which crops perform best in which season.

2. Profit By Crop
Purpose: Displays total profit generated by each crop.

Insight: Maize has the highest profit, followed by Wheat and Rice, while Cotton has the lowest.

3. Revenue By Farming Method
Purpose: Pie chart illustrating revenue generated through different farming methods: Organic, Conventional, Hydroponic, and Mixed.

Insight: Organic farming yields the highest revenue, indicating a strong market preference or premium.

4. Yield Ton By Region
Purpose: Regional breakdown of crop yield to identify productivity by area (East, North, South, West).

Insight: Western and Eastern regions have higher total yields, helping focus efforts on high-performing zones.
